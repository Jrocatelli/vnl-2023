# Volleyball Nations League 2023 Women's Statistics Analysis

As a passionate volleyball enthusiast, this project aims to analyze the performance of women players in the 2023 Volleyball Nations League (VNL) based on statistics. The indicators utilized for analysis are available on the [VNL website](https://en.volleyballworld.com/volleyball/competitions/volleyball-nations-league/2023/finals-statistics/
), from which the data was extracted to create a comprehensive database.

At the beginning of this educational journey, the intention is to analyze this data, create dashboards using PowerBI, set up databases, execute SQL queries, and conduct simple analyses using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. This README file will be periodically updated to reflect progress made in the project.

## 1. Data Extraction
The data for this project is sourced from the official Volleyball Nations League website. I utilized the Python libraries `requests`, `pandas`, and `BeautifulSoup` to retrieve the HTML code from each of the seven pages (one for each volleyball action) and to extract the relevant table components, which were then organized into a DataFrame.

Further steps and progress updates will be provided in subsequent sections. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrocatelli/)!
